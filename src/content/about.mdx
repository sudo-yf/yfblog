Hi! I'm **Yifan**, a 19-year-old student at [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/) (SCUT).

I'm passionate about **music**, especially the bedroom pop genre. My favorite artist is [icyball](https://www.icyball.com/), whose dreamy, lo-fi soundscapes really resonate with me. Music is not just a hobby—it's a big part of who I am and how I express myself.

When I'm not listening to music or studying, I enjoy exploring new technologies, writing on this blog, and connecting with like-minded people online.

Feel free to reach out to me:
